# CPP Distributed Multi-BruteForce-Algorithm

&nbsp; Distributed Brute Force Algorithm made in cpp. A client  connects and sends the required info
(IP , PORT, USERNAME, PASSWORDLIST). When master receives this values from the client ,  he forwards to all the slaves the values IP , PORT, USERNAME.
For each of the slaves, master makes a subset from the PASSWORDLIST and pass it to each slave(let subset of PASSWORDLIST be PASSWORDLISTsubset). Each slave, open threads and sends a get request to IP PORT with the
username and a password from PASSWORDLISTsubset). Slave opens threads and tries passwords from the PASSWORDLISTsubset, until the PASSWORDLISTsubset have no more elements or the correct password is found.

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
